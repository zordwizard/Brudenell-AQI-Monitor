# Brudenell-AQI-Monitor
Experimental Python script for retrieving the AQI value from accuweather.com
The current iteration is admittedly terrible. Comments must be made. 
Also, Selenium is built for webtesting, not scraping as a whole.
Scrapy may save the project, bc, as it stands, this program is garbage because the time it

Currently using Selenium, PySimpleGUI, and Firefox & Geckodriver.
